I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in May 2024. I am an incoming Ph.D. student at SUTD, advised by Prof. Soujanya Poria. My research interest lies in Large Language Models and MultiModels. In my undergraduate period, I was fortunate to have opportunity to conduct research under Prof. Roy Ka-Wei Lee and Prof. Soujanya Poria.
